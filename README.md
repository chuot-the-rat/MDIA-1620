3-2-1 (but opposite order) 

1 Word for how youâ€™re feeling
- YYOOOWWWWWWW (because I got stung by a wasp and it still hurts)

2 Things that are still unclear 
- Class outline 
- Dont know how to ask questions exactly just yet 
- What is git vs github

3 Aha moment
- Shoe box sized file of code using hole punches 
- The uses of github and being able to go back to previous versions in case something goes wrong 
- The group chat texting analogy also with google doc :)))))
