Week 2 - 3-2-1s

1 Word for how youâ€™re feeling
- YYOOOWWWWWWW (because I got stung by a wasp and it still hurts)

2 Things that are still unclear 
- Class outline 
- Dont know how to ask questions exactly just yet 
- What is git vs github

3 Aha moment
- Shoe box sized file of code using hole punches 
- The uses of github and being able to go back to previous versions in case something goes wrong 
- The group chat texting analogy also with google doc 


Week 6 - my 3 and 3 

3 things I understand
- i think i understand if statements well because it feels like following very specific rules and i kind of like that lol 
- i like arrays very cool its like a list of information and it just holds it in the order we want and we pull info out very nice
- looking at unorganized code sucks and hurts my eyes 

3 confusing things
- not that this is specific to what we learned but i was wondering why we use javascript instead of other languages
- is there such thing as a var name that is too long? 
- why do we save things like introductions in a let statement then log it out instead of just console.log-ing it
